Health economics analysis
-------------------------

1.  [Decision trees](#decisiontree) 
2.  [Multistate models](#multistatemodel)
3.  [Optimal decision process](#optdecisionprocess)
4.  [Cost-effectiveness analysis](#costeffectiveness)
5.  [Visualisation](#visualisation)

Below we list the most useful R packages that we know of for each area.


Decision trees
--------------

These packages help you 

-   [data.tree](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr) - General Purpose Hierarchical Data Structure
-   [jsonlite](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) - A Robust, High Performance JSON Parser and Generator for R
-   [rjson](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) - JSON for R
-   [jsonvalidate](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) - Validate 'JSON'


Multistate models
-----------------

These packages help you 

-   [mstate]() - Data Preparation, Estimation and Prediction in Multi-State Models
-   [etm]() - Empirical Transition Matrix
-   [flexsurv]() - Flexible Parametric Survival and Multi-State Models
-   [ggm]() - Functions for graphical Markov models
-   [msm]() - Multi-State Markov and Hidden Markov Models in Continuous Time

The closely related area of survival analysis has its own [CRAN Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Survival.html)


Optimal decision processes
--------------------------

These packages optimal control, dynamic programming, maximum utility.

-   [MDPtoolbox](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/03/29/feather/) - Markov Decision Processes Toolbox
-   [linprog]() - Linear Programming / Optimization



Cost-effectiveness analysis
---------------------------

-   [BCEA]() - Bayesian Cost Effectiveness Analysis
-   [DALY]() - The DALY Calculator - Graphical User Interface for Probabilistic DALY Calculation in R
-   [heemod]() - Models for Health Economic Evaluation
-   [iSQoL2]() - Integration of Survival with QoL or Cost
-   [radiant](http://vnijs.github.io/radiant/) - Business Analytics using R and Shiny


Visualisation
-------------

These packages make it easier to program with the R language.

-   [diagram](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) - Functions for visualising simple graphs (networks), plotting flow diagrams
-   [DiagrammeR](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Server) - Create Graph Diagrams and Flowcharts Using R


Data
----

These packages contain data sets to use as training data or toy examples.

-   [rgho](https://github.com/hadley/babynames) - Access WHO Global Health Observatory Data from R
